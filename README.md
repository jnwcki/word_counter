# word_counter
Returns the 20 most used words from a text file

This was an assignment during my first week of the Iron Yard in which we practiced opening files,
cleaning data and putting it into python collections. The normal mode (word_frequency.py) of the assignment opens a sample
text file and returns a count of the most used words in the text.

The hard mode of the assignment (wordfreq.py) added the ability to scan a user-provided file from the command line 
and output the results with a visual histogram
